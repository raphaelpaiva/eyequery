 #Source archetype:# jboss-jsf-weld-servlet-webapp

 What is it?
 ===========

 Eyequery is intended to be a graphical database query authoring tool, allowing
 non-technical business-users to query useful information without the help from
 developers.

 System requirements
 ===================

 All you need to run this project is Java 5.0 (Java SDK 1.5) or greater and
 Maven 2.0.10 or greater. This application is setup to be run on a Servlet
 Container. The embedded Jetty and Tomcat containers get downloaded
 automatically by the Maven commands.

 If you want to deploy the application to a standalone Servlet Container, then
 you will need to set one up.

 Please note that Maven 2 project needs to use the JBoss Maven repository
 because there are certain Java EE API JARs that are not yet publised to the
 Maven Central Repository (see https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/WELD-222)

 Deploying the application
 =========================

 You can deploy the application without moving any files around using the
 embedded Jetty or Tomcat containers.

 To run the application using embedded Jetty, execute this command:

  mvn jetty:run

 To run the application using embedded Tomcat, execute this command:

  mvn compile tomcat:run

 The application will be running at the following URL:
 
  http://localhost:9090/eyequery

 To run the application on a standalone container, first execute this command:

  mvn package

 Then copy the archive target/jboss-jsf-weld-servlet-webapp.war to the hot deploy directory of
 the container (e.g., the webapps directory of Tomcat). Of course, you also
 need to start the container.

 The default settings use Mojarra 2, the JSF 2 reference implementation. If you
 want to use MyFaces 2 instead, just add the -Djsf=myfaces flag to any of the
 commands above.

  mvn jetty:run -Djsf=myfaces

 The application will work just as before, except the JSF functionality will be
 powered by MyFaces.

 Importing the project into an IDE
 =================================

 If you created the project using the Maven 2 archetype wizard in your IDE
 (Eclipse, NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA), then there is nothing to do. You should
 already have an IDE project.

 If you created the project from the commandline using archetype:generate, then
 you need to bring the project into your IDE. If you are using NetBeans 6.8 or
 IntelliJ IDEA 9, then all you have to do is open the project as an existing
 project. Both of these IDEs recognize Maven 2 projects natively.

 To import into Eclipse, you first need to install the m2eclipse plugin. To get
 started, add the m2eclipse update site (http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/update/)
 to Eclipse and install the m2eclipse plugin and required dependencies. Once
 that is installed, you'll be ready to import the project into Eclipse.

 Select File > Import... and select "Import... > Maven Projects" and select
 your project directory. m2eclipse should take it from there.

 Once in the IDE, you can execute the Maven commands through the IDE controls
 to run the application on an embedded Servlet Container.

 Downloading the sources and Javadocs
 ====================================

 If you want to be able to debug into the source code or look at the Javadocs
 of any library in the project, you can run either of the following two
 commands to pull them into your local repository. The IDE should then detect
 them.

  mvn dependency:sources
  mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
